# Beeshi's own forms website (INCOMPLETE + ABANDONED)

**Q1: What is this project?**

This is a forms website where people can create forms and let the internet surfers interact and fill the forms on this website.
<br>Every form will be created can be featured in the website for anyone to fill them out instead of doing the steps of sharing the recently created form from google forms to the public using social media platforms such as WhatsApp.

**Q2: When did you start this project?**

This project was created and abandoned in the late 2021.
<br>The reason why I stopped creating the project can be found in **Q3**.

**Q3: Why did you make this project?**

A great friend of mine requested me to create a google forms for his graduation research. I was very passion about making side projects for programming practicing. I suggested the idea of making my own forms website.
<br>He wasn't into the idea of creating a new website from scratch for his research due to the fact it could take a long time coding it. I accepted the challenge of creating this side project in the shortest amount of time possible.
<br>I've done doing 80% of the coding in less than 12 hours. I only needed to add some graphs related to the submitted form's answers to sort them in a way which the basic user could understand.
<br>I presented the demonstrate version of the website to my friend to encourage him to depend on my side project instead of using google forms. He delined the idea of launching the website. Then I made a basic google forms for him.
